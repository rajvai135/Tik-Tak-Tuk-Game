# Tik-Tak-Tuk-Game
Tik Tak Tuk is a simple two-player game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The first to align three marks in a row—horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—wins. The game includes basic logic for turn-switching, win detection, draw checking, and a reset option.
